# **HM Watch Apps License (HMWA-1.1)**
_For Synchronet Shell Projects by HM Watch Apps / Futureland.today_

## **1. Purpose**
This license encourages creativity and learning within the BBS community while preventing “stock” or clone-like deployments that dilute the uniqueness of the original work and the Futureland experience.

The intent is simple: **sysops may use this shell freely for personal use**, but **public, stock deployments are prohibited** unless explicitly authorized.

## **2. Definitions**
- **Sysop** — The system operator or owner of a BBS.
- **Public Users / Non-Sysop Users** — Callers, members, guests, or anyone other than the sysop.
- **Meaningful Customization** — Distinct visual or behavioral modifications including, for example, custom icons, colors, menu definitions, artwork, or functionality.
- **Stock / Clone** — A deployment substantially indistinguishable from the Licensor’s original appearance, artwork, menus, or user experience.

## **3. Default License (Implicit, No Application Needed)**
Under this default license, **sysop-only use** is automatically granted.

### 3.1 Sysop Personal Use
Any sysop may install and use the Software as a personal shell on their BBS. The Software may connect to their own host and/or to the **Futureland Gateway** at [futureland.today](https://futureland.today).

### 3.2 Source as Example
All source code is provided as an **example** for study and inspiration. You may adapt snippets or concepts for your own programs or shells.

### 3.3 No Public Access
You **may not** grant shell access to Public Users under the default license. Only the sysop may use it.

> Under this default license, you may run unmodified or modified copies — since only you (the sysop) will see it.

## **4. Extended / Permissive License (Required for Public Access)**
Public (non-sysop) access to the Software requires a license extension granted by **HM Watch Apps** on a case-by-case basis.

The Licensor gladly grants extended use rights to those who **actively enrich the BBS ecosystem**, such as:
- Art groups or individuals who publish ANSI/ASCII packs (e.g., via 16Colors).
- Developers of new door games, mods, or creative Synchronet extensions.
- Sysops maintaining innovative, customized, or long-running BBS systems that contribute to the culture.

### 4.1 Mandatory Customization
Even with an Extended License, **you must meaningfully customize** your deployment before making it available to Public Users.
Running an unmodified or clone-like version for Public Users is **strictly prohibited**.

### 4.2 No Sale Implied
This license does not establish a price or imply that the Software is for sale. All grants are discretionary.

### 4.3 Attribution (Optional)
The Licensor may request light credit (e.g., an “About” or “Powered by” note). No prominent branding is required unless separately agreed.

### 4.4 Revocation
If your public deployment becomes stock/clone-like or violates this agreement, your Extended License may be revoked.

## **5. Absolutely Not Allowed (Under Any License)**
- Granting public/non-sysop access without an Extended License.
- Running an unmodified or clone-like public deployment.
- Misrepresenting endorsement, affiliation, or origin.
- Removing license notices or applicable copyright headers.

## **6. Enforcement**
Violation of this license — especially hosting a stock/clone-like public shell without permission — may result in a **cease-and-desist** order and pursuit of damages where applicable.

## **7. Project Abandonment → Freeware Fallback**
If the **Futureland BBS**, or any successor host operated by the Licensor, is continuously offline or inactive for a substantial period (for example, **12 consecutive months**) with no indication of continued development or community involvement, this Software shall automatically become **freeware**.

Upon that transition:
- All restrictions under this license are lifted for the **last released version** prior to abandonment (the “Legacy Version”).
- Users may freely use, modify, and redistribute that Legacy Version without further permission.

If development is later resumed or new versions are released, those **new or updated versions** shall be governed by whatever license accompanies them.
This does **not** revoke freeware status for the Legacy Version — it remains permanently freeware.

## **8. Warranty & Liability**
The Software is provided **“as is”**, without any warranty, express or implied.
Use at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Licensor disclaims all liability for any loss, damage, or harm resulting from use of the Software.

## **9. Miscellany**
- This license is governed by the laws of the Licensor’s home jurisdiction, unless required otherwise by local law.
- If any clause is found unenforceable, the remainder shall remain in effect.
- Nothing in this license restricts fair use, academic study, or other rights guaranteed by law.
